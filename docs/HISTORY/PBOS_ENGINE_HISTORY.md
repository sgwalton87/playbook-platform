## 2026-07-24
- PBOS Engine v2 introduced persistent state, reusable execution modes, rule evaluation, structured validation, standardized reports, history updates, and ledger updates.
- Selected gate during planning validation: PBOS-GATE-001.
- Recommendation: complete PBOS-GATE-001, then evaluate PBOS-RLS-001.

## 2026-07-24T01:28:59.606Z
- PBOS Engine 2.0.0 ran in planning mode.
- Selected gate: PBOS-GATE-001.
- Recommendation: Complete PBOS-GATE-001, then evaluate PBOS-RLS-001.

## 2026-07-24T01:58:20.578Z
- PBOS Engine 3.0.0 ran in planning mode.
- Selected gate: PBOS-GATE-001.
- Recommendation: Complete PBOS-GATE-001, then evaluate PBOS-RLS-001. PBOS-RLS-001 is next because it follows PBOS-GATE-001 in the machine-readable gate sequence without skipping dependencies.

## 2026-07-24T01:58:35.078Z
- PBOS Engine 3.0.0 ran in planning mode.

- Recommendation: Complete PBOS-GATE-001, then evaluate PBOS-RLS-001. PBOS-RLS-001 is next because it follows PBOS-GATE-001 in the machine-readable gate sequence without skipping dependencies.

## 2026-07-24T01:59:00.530Z

- Recommendation: Complete PBOS-GATE-001, then evaluate PBOS-RLS-001. PBOS-RLS-001 is next because it follows PBOS-GATE-001 in the machine-readable gate sequence without skipping dependencies.

## 2026-07-24T02:01:31.097Z

- Selected gate: PBOS-GATE-001.
- Recommendation: Complete PBOS-GATE-001, then evaluate PBOS-RLS-001. PBOS-RLS-001 is next because it follows PBOS-GATE-001 in the machine-readable gate sequence without skipping dependencies.

## 2026-07-24 — PBOS Engine v3 Release Candidate
- PBOS Engine v3 passed planning-mode runtime validation and is accepted as the current PBOS runtime baseline.
- Future PBOS architecture changes should be proposed through PBOS gates instead of broad rewrites.
- First real Playbook implementation work should continue through PBOS-GATE-001 to reduce release-gate lint debt.

## 2026-07-24T02:40:56.542Z
- PBOS Engine 3.0.0 ran in planning mode.
- Selected gate: PBOS-GATE-001.
- Recommendation: Repository promotion is pending. Resolve promotion blockers before starting another engineering gate: Git remote unavailable, Git credentials unavailable, Pull Request creation unavailable, Release tag creation unavailable.


## 2026-07-24 — PBOS Release State Machine
- PBOS added a deterministic release state machine separating engineering validation, repository promotion, and release audit.
- Current release state remains PROMOTION_PENDING because this environment lacks Git remote and credential access.
- Engineering approval remains valid and is not invalidated by repository promotion environment limits.
